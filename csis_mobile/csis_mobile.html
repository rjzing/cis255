							<p class = "page_text"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Computer Science program and Computer Information Systems program share many of the same core classes to ensure 
							that students are adequately prepared with the necessary background for their upper class studies.  This common core includes programming 
							both in a Windows graphical environment as well as in a UNIX command-line environment.  Industry uses both operating systems and so the 
							Department wants students to be well versed in each area.  Additionally, students will learn C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic as toolsets 
							to develop applications.  The common core also includes introductory data structures, statistics with computer applications, web client 
							development and web server development.  Both majors are heavily programming-oriented.  The curriculum has been designed this way on purpose 
							so that students can learn about a concept and then use their programming knowledge as a vehicle to understand, experiment and implement that topic.  
							Both programs do a great job in preparing students for their future in industry or to pursue a graduate degree</p>

						<img src="images/svsu_careerservices.png" alt="careerservices" width="75%" height="75%"><br />
						<p class = "page_text"><span class = "header">Why Choose SVSU for CSIS:</span><br /><br />
						<span class = "header">1) Quality Instruction</span><br /><br />
						Faculty have the necessary education and experience to bring real world knowledge into their classrooms.  SVSU prides itself on being a teaching 
						institution and the Department continually strives to provide the best instruction on campus.  Our programs and our curriculum are continually 
						evaluated and change as the computing field and industry evolve.  We put a lot of effort into trying to keep our programs as up-to-date as possible 
						and bring in new technology wherever we can.<br /><br />
						<span class = "header">2) Capstone Projects</span><br /><br />
						How would you like to work on a real-world project while still an undergraduate?  That’s exactly what the capstone projects in each major do.  
						When you are a senior you’ll find out what it’s really like to be in industry because you’ll be building up a large scale system under the 
						guidance of a CSIS faculty member.  Few other institutions afford their students this unique learning opportunity.<br /><br />
						<span class = "header">3)  Use of the Latest Software</span><br /><br />
						The Department provides hands-on instruction using the latest and most popular software packages available, including both open source 
						and commercial systems such as Visual Studio, PHP, C++, Linux, Windows, IIS, Apache, Microsoft Project, Visio, mySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, 
						Expression Studio and DreamWeaver.<br /><br />
						<span class = "header">4)  Free Student Access to Software</span><br /><br />
						The CSIS Department uses open source software where applicable and students may freely download the same software for their personal computers.  
						The Department also participates in the Microsoft Academic Alliance which means that students have free access to the same applications, 
						development tools, operating systems and server software for their personal computers as that used in classes and labs.<br /><br />
						<span class = "header">5)   Networking with Industry</span><br /><br />
						The Department maintains close ties to local industry.  This means that CSIS students have the ability to land internships, 
						co-op positions and part-time employment in their field while still an undergraduate.  In addition to a paycheck, the experience 
						this opportunity provides goes a long way toward landing that first job after graduation.  Many employers also contact the Department 
						directly when they are looking to hire new recruits for full time positions.<br /><br />

						<p class = "page_text">Where do our graduates go after graduation?<br />
						Some students go on to complete graduate work and earn master’s degrees and Ph.D.s.  Our programs prepare 
						students for grad school if that’s what they are interested in.  Many have pursued graduate degrees at 
						institutions in the state such as Michigan State University, Oakland University, The University of Michigan 
						and Central Michigan University.  Others have gone on to schools in other states and done very well.<br />
						For the majority of our students, they decide to enter the workforce after graduation.  Our name is recognized 
						as producing skilled employees…a fact that we are very proud of.  In fact many local and regional employers return 
						to SVSU year after year to hire our Computer Science and Information System student graduates.<br />
						Our students have even successfully started their own companies right after graduating from SVSU!<br /><br />
						
						Some will work for local companies such as: <br />
						
						<ul>
							<li>Saginaw Tooling Systems</li>
							<li>The Saginaw Intermediate School District</li>
							<li>SVSU</li>
							<li>Delta College</li>
							<li>Mahar Tools</li>
							<li>...and many others</li>
						</ul><br />
						
						Regional employers attract others, like:<br />
						
						<ul>
							<li>Auto Owners Insurance</li>
							<li>Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance</li>
							<li>Covenant Healthcare</li>
							<li>Rehmann Group</li>
							<li>McLaren Health Care Corporation</li>
							<li>Ascension Health</li>
							<li>Yeo & Yeo</li>
							<li>...among others</li>
						</ul><br />
						
						Others even make careers immediately at multinational corporations including: <br />
						
						<ul>
							<li>Dow Chemical</li>
							<li>IBM</li>
							<li>Dow Corning</li>
							<li>General Motors</li>
							<li>Electronic Data Systems</li>

						The Computer Information Systems program and Computer Science program share many of the same core classes to ensure that students are 
						adequately prepared with the necessary background for their upper class studies.  This common core includes programming both in a Windows 
						graphical environment as well as in a Unix command-line environment.  Industry uses both operating systems and so the Department wants 
						students to be well versed in each area.  Additionally, students will learn C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic as toolsets to develop applications.  
						The common core also includes introductory data structures, statistics with computer applications, web client development and web server development.  
						Both majors are heavily programming-oriented.  The curriculum has been designed this way on purpose so that students can learn about a concept and 
						then use their programming knowledge as a vehicle to understand, experiment and implement that topic.  Both programs do a great job in preparing 
						students for their future in industry or to pursue a graduate degree. <br />
						Computer Information Systems tends to be more application oriented than Computer Science and geared toward application development with some business 
						emphasis.  Computer Information Systems majors will see the following in their degree program: Topical Coverage Synopsis: Models, technologies, systems 
						and E-business strategies that are crucial in today’s businesses.<br />
						<h4 class = "faculty">Cutting-edge technology skills and knowledge:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Application Areas: Data Communications, Database, e-Commerce, .NET development</li>
							<li>Technical Topics: system integration & management, systems design and analysis, enterprise database systems & transaction processing and much more</li>
